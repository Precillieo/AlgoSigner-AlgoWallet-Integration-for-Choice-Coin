## Precious Kolawole's Female Developers' Grants Silver Badge Submission 

 The task is to build a functional frontend integration with the Algorand JavaScript-SDK and [AlgoSigner](https://www.purestake.com/technology/algosigner/) or the [Algorand Mobile Wallet](https://algorandwallet.com/).
 
 ### Functionality
* The program defines two addresses called: `zero_address` and `one_address`.
* The program connects the voter's wallet to the application via AlgoSigner and the Algorand Wallet.
* The program defines an `if` statement which is included in a defined function.
* The `if` statement determines whether `X Choice` is sent from `voter's wallet` to `zero_address` or `one_address`.
* The program allows the user to enter a variable amount of `Choice`, which will be sent upon clicking the Submit Button.
* If `Yes` is selected and the user clicks the Submit Button, then the program sends `X Choice` from the voter's wallet to the zero_address.
* If `No` is selected and the user clicks the Submit Button, then the program sends `X Choice` from the voter's wallet to the one_addres.
* The web interface returns the transaction ID.
